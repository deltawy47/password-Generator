# Password Generator

 Password Generator is the simple compiled application developed within C++. This application is based on low-level languages, C++. 

  Password Generator uses  Random math function to get very random number between  0 : (all of letters and numbers)  that is stored in array and connected in the end to get our    Random password 

## Prerequisites

* C++
* Visual Studio Code (Recommended but not obligatory)

## Installing

Step One : Clone the repo without checking out a work tree.
```
git clone -n <repo-url>
```
Step Two : check out the file.
```
git checkout master -- path/within/repo/to/file
```

## Running the tests

* Run intro.py to see the result of the man shooting bullets. Your score is on the top right screen. You get 1 score by hitting goblin with bullets and subtract score 5 if you are hit by goblins.

## Break down into end to end tests

No Break down into end to end tests required.

## And coding style tests

No coding style tests required.

## Built With

*C++  is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
* Visual Studio Code : Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes embedded Git and support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is highly customizable, allowing users to change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality. The source code is free and open-source, released under the permissive MIT License. The compiled binaries are freeware for any use.
